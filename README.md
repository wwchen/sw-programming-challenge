Startup Weekend Programming Challenge
========================

So you're thinking about changing the world with us through your code? That's great!

We would love to see how you work, so we're opening up this challenge for you to show us your chops.

## About the Challenge

We care about making meaningful stories out of all the data we store--both for reporting purposes
and for operations planning. Obviously, we track a lot of information about our events. In fact,
we even have an API built up to expose event data.

I'd like to give you some flexibility here. Given a list of events in JSON format, what
is the most interesting story you can tell with the data? Maybe it is interesting to show
a heat map of events over time by location. Maybe it would be helpful to our operations
team to show us the amount of time since the last event in a city. Let your imagination
go wild.

You can use any language or framework you like, but we use lots of Node.js on the backend
and Backbone.js on the front-end. We also like Ruby, but we might also need to move to a
new platform as we grow.

Your tech stack choice will either show me how able you are to hit the ground running on
day 1 or how you will help us grow in the futuer.

## What We're Looking For

The actual problem itself is somewhat trivial; we want an opportunity to see how you
work. 

* Creativity - We are a group of passionate people--can you make us excited about your ideas?
* Code Organization - Does your work make sense? Show me how you think about code,
components, and modules.
* Documentation - We don't code alone. Am I going to be able to understand what 
you're doing when you update our codebase?
* Commit habits - Do you commit in small chunks? Commit early and often because I want to see your
progress forthis challenge, but we also encourage small commits to make our lives easier when we do
code reviews or big merges.
* Tests - Again, this might not be a challenging problem, but I want to see that you can 
write testable code and think about how your functions will be used.

## How To Play

Fork this repository and [send us an email](mailto://tech@startupweekend.org) asking for instructions
on using our API.

When you are finished, you can submit a Pull Request and we will review what you have done.

Feel free to add other Markdown files or replace this README to explain what you are doing.

Adding a little bit about yourself or adding links to your other interesting profiles would be
appropriate as well.
